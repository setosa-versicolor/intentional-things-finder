## 1. Colectivo Coffee (Monroe Street)

**Story**: Part of the largest cafe union in the nation, but that's not why you go. The Monroe Street location occupies a repurposed garage with massive windows that flood the space with light. It's a chain, technically, but the neighborhood treats it like it isn't.

**Nudge**: Weekday mornings before 10am. Grab the window counter facing Monroe if it's open. The breakfast burrito is better than it needs to be.

## 2. Johnson Public House (JPH)

**Story**: Almost cult-like following among Tenney-Lapham residents for good reason. They rotate through Intelligentsia, their own roaster Kin Kin, and premium guests like Blueprint and Four Barrel. Ten years in, still the neighborhood's living room.

**Nudge**: Sunday morning. Sit at the long communal table. Eavesdrop responsibly. The cortado is dialed in.

## 3. EVP Coffee

**Story**: Woman-owned since 1997, air-roasting beans daily in small batches. Over 25 years of not cutting corners. The spaces are bright and utilitarian—you're here for the coffee, not the Instagram.

**Nudge**: Try the pour-over. They'll walk you through their current single origins without being precious about it. Early morning gets you the freshest roast.

## 4. Leopold's Book Bar & Cafe

**Story**: Bookstore, bar, and coffee shop that commits fully to all three. The vintage Elektra espresso machine produces Italian-inspired drinks while craft cocktails happen at the other end of the bar. Books organized by country of origin, not genre—which tells you everything about the kind of place this is.

**Nudge**: Night owl hours make it rare. Come late with a book you bought there. Order an Aperol spritz and a cortado. Rotate between them.

## 5. Cafe Domestique

**Story**: Bike-themed cafe sharing space with The Cargo Bike Shop. Owner spent 20 years in the bike industry and it shows—the crowd knows a derailleur from a dropout. Coffee from Intelligentsia, Ruby, Square Mile, and Onyx Coffee Lab rotates through.

**Nudge**: If you ride, ride there. Lock up outside, order the espresso tonic in summer. The pre-ride crowd peaks around 8am on weekends.

**Do these match the voice? Should I continue with the rest of the coffee shops and move through all categories?**
