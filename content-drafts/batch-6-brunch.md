# Brunch & Breakfast - Complete Content

## 1. Sardine

**Story**: Universally agreed to be Madison's best brunch. Lake Monona waterfront location with French fare where it's easy to let hours slip away over drinks with friends. The view does half the work.

**Nudge**: Make a reservation. Request patio if weather allows. Come with time—this isn't a quick meal and shouldn't be.

**Story**: Brunch all day on weekends. Classics like pancakes, French toast, omelets alongside unique dishes like three grain tempeh bowl and duck confit hash. Pinckney Street spot that takes breakfast seriously.

**Nudge**: Weekend mornings before 10am avoids the rush. The duck confit hash if you're adventurous, the French toast if you're not. Both are correct.
