## 1. Gib's Bar

**Story**: Innovative craft cocktails built into a two-story Victorian house on Willy Street. The Nitro Amaretto Sour with bourbon, pineapple cordial, orange, and argan oil is their signature. Neighborhood favorite that doesn't feel like a neighborhood bar.

**Nudge**: Weeknight around 7pm. Sit upstairs if it's available—better atmosphere. Let the bartender know what you usually drink and trust their recommendation.
